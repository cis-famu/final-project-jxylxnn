              <p class="lead">"Born and raised in a different country, my journey to the United States was marked by both challenges and triumphs. The most significant part of my story is moving to the U.S. with my single mother, a journey that taught me resilience, adaptability, and the value of hard work. Growing up, I found solace and passion in music, leading me to join the school band. This experience not only honed my musical skills but also instilled in me a sense of discipline and teamwork.

                My dedication to music and academics opened the door to Florida A&M University (FAMU), a place where I could further nurture my talents and ambitions. At FAMU, I've been able to immerse myself in a culturally rich environment, embracing both the academic rigor and the vibrant campus life. My story is one of perseverance, cultural adaptation, and the pursuit of dreams against all odds. It's a narrative of how a young person, alongside a supportive single mother, can cross continents and overcome challenges to find their place in a new world and thrive in it."</p>
